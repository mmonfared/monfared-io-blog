[{"categories":null,"content":"What is Appium? Appium\ris an open-source project and ecosystem designed to facilitate UI automation for a wide range of app platforms, including:\nMobile: iOS, Android, Tizen Browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari Desktop: macOS, Windows TV: Roku, tvOS, Android TV, Samsung, and more. In other words, Appium does the same as selenium but for mobile applications! With the release of Appium 2.0, it aims to achieve the following primary goals:\nMake platform-specific automation capabilities available under a cross-platform, standard API (Compatible with W3C WebDriver protocol). Allow easy access to this API from any programming language. Provide tools for convenient community development of Appium extensions. Appium Architecture\rAppium leverages the WebDriver specification as its API (Including groundbreaking Actions API\rfor its Gestures actions). This choice was influenced by Selenium, a long-standing pioneer in UI automation for web browsers. Selenium\u0026rsquo;s stable API for browser automation served as a solid foundation, and Appium extended it to support mobile apps (iOS and Android). By adopting the WebDriver spec, Appium ensures a unified approach to automation across platforms.\nWhile user interactions on websites and native mobile apps differ, the commonalities in software UIs allow the WebDriver spec to map effectively to any platform. Appium\u0026rsquo;s goal is to provide a consistent experience for developers and testers, regardless of the underlying technology. In this series of articles, I will explain in detail how to use Appium to perform mobile gestures like zoom, scroll, swipe, drag and drop, and more, using the latest techniques and APIs.\nW3C Actions API\r(W3C Mobile Gestures Actions)[https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver/blob/master/docs/android-mobile-gestures.md] (UiScrollable Class)[https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/test/uiautomator/UiScrollable] (Deprecated) (Appium Gestures Plugin)[https://github.com/AppiumTestDistribution/appium-gestures-plugin] TouchAction | MultiAction (Deprecated, but it is worth mentioning since a lot of projects still use it) ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/1-appium-gestures-part1/","tags":null,"title":"Gestures in Appium - Part 1 - History | Element/Display Rectangular | W3C ActionsAPI | Setup"}]
